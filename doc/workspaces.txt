INTRODUCTION                                                      *workspaces*

workspaces.nvim provides a few simple commands for managing workspace
directories in neovim. A workspace is a name and a path, and opening a
workspace will set the current directory to the correct path.

* Register a workspace with |:Workspaces add|
* Open a registered workspace with `:Workspaces open [name]`
* Hooks may be registered to provide additional functionality
* A telescope extension |:Telescope workspaces| is provided for fuzzy finding
  over workspaces

Nothing runs automatically. The idea is that workspace creation is an
infrequent task, so there shouldn't be any need for automatic workspace
registration, or heuristics to determine if a directory is a workspace. A
command and telescope extension are provided to make it simple to open a
workspace, but what that means beyond changing directories is left up to you by
customizing the hooks.

CONFIGURATION                                       *workspaces-configuration*

Call the setup function with a table as the argument to override the default
configuration. >

    require("workspaces").setup({
        -- path to a file to store workspaces data in
        -- on a unix system this would be ~/.local/share/nvim/workspaces
        path = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. util.path.sep .. "workspaces",

        -- to change directory for all of nvim (:cd) or only for the current
        -- window (:lcd). if you are unsure, you likely want this to be true.
        -- global_cd = true,

        -- controls how the directory is changed. valid options are "global", "local", and "tab"
        --   "global" changes directory for the neovim process. same as the :cd command
        --   "local" changes directory for the current window. same as the :lcd command
        --   "tab" changes directory for the current tab. same as the :tcd command
        --
        -- if set, overrides the value of global_cd
        cd_type = "global",

        -- sort the list of workspaces by name after loading from the
        -- workspaces path.
        sort = true,

        -- sort by recent use rather than by name. requires sort to be true
        mru_sort = true,

        -- option to automatically activate workspace when opening neovim in a workspace directory
        auto_open = false,

        -- enable info-level notifications after adding or removing a
        -- workspace. disable to only be notified for warnings or errors.
        notify_info = true,

        -- lists of hooks to run after specific actions
        -- hooks can be a lua function or a vim command (string)
        -- if only one hook is needed, the list may be omitted
        hooks = {
            add = {},
            remove = {},
            open_pre = {}, -- run before changing directory
            open = {},     -- run after changing directory
        },
    })

USAGE                                                       *workspaces-usage*

:WorkspacesAdd [name] [path]                            *WorkspacesAdd*

If both name and path are omitted, the current working directory will be
registered as a workspace, with the last path segment as the name.

If only name is provided, one of two actions will follow. (1) if name looks
like a path, that path will be registered, (2) otherwise the current working
directory will be registered as a workspace, with the given name.

if both name and path are provided, the workspace with name and path will be
registered.

:WorkspacesAddDir [path]                                *WorkspacesAddDir*

If the path is omitted, the current working directory will be
registered as a directory, with the last path segment as the name.

Each subfolder of this directory will be automatically registered as a
workspace.

:WorkspacesRemove [name]                                *WorkspacesRemove*

If name is omitted, the workspace registered in the current working
directory will be removed, if it exists.

If name is provided, the specified workspace will be removed.

:WorkspacesRemoveDir [name]                             *WorkspacesRemoveDir*

If name is omitted, the directory registered in the current working
directory will be removed, if it exists.

If name is provided, the specified directory will be removed.

When a directory is removed, all of its subfolders registered as workspaces
are also removed.

:WorkspacesList                                         *WorkspacesList*

Prints all workspaces.

:WorkspacesListDirs                                     *WorkspacesListDirs*

Prints all directories.

:WorkspacesOpen [name]                                  *WorkspacesOpen*

Opens the named workspace. If no name is given, vim.ui.select() will be used
as a selection interface for opening a workspace.

:WorkspacesSyncDirs [name]                              *WorkspacesSyncDirs*

For every registered directory, synchronizes workspaces based on the file
system.

If a directory subfolder has been removed or added, it will also be removed or
added from the registered workspaces.

All commands that take a workspace name (|:WorkspacesOpen| and
|:WorkspacesRemove|) offer workspace name completion. |:WorkspacesAdd| offers
filepath completion.

==============================================================================
HOOKS                                                       *workspaces-hooks*

There are 4 types of hooks that can be registered in three categories: add,
remove, and open.

Each hook may be either a single command or Lua function, or a list of
commands and Lua functions. See |workspaces-examples| for reference. If the
hook is a Lua function, it will be passed the workspace name and workspace
path as parameters.

If a Lua function hook returns false, any other registered hooks in the list
will be skipped. Furthermore, if the hook is an open_pre hook and returns
false, the directory will not be changed and any registered post-open hooks
will not be run.

add~
    run hooks after adding a workspace

remove~
    run hooks after removing a workspace

open~
    run hooks after changing directory when opening a workspace

open_pre~
    run hooks before changing directory when opening a workspace

API                                                           *workspaces-api*

local workspaces = require("workspaces")

workspaces.setup(opts: {table})
    Setup custom configuration and user commands. The details of opts are
    documented in |workspaces-configuration|

workspaces.add(path: {string}, name: {string})
    Add a workspace with the given name and path. If name or path are nil, the
    current directory will be used to set the missing parameter.

workspaces.add_dir(path: {string})
    Add a directory with the given path. Register all its subfolders as
    workspaces.

workspaces.remove(name: {string})
    Remove a workspace with the given name.

workspaces.remove_dir(path: {string})
    Remove a directory and all its associated workspaces.

workspaces.list()
    Print all workspaces to the commandline.

workspaces.list_dirs()
    Print all directories to the commandline.

workspaces.open(name: {string}|{nil})
    Open a workspace with the given name. If name is nil, vim.ui.select() will be
    used as a selection interface for opening a workspace.

workspaces.get(): {table}
    Returns a list of all workspaces in { name: {string}, path: {string},
                                          last_opened: {string} }
    pairs.

workspaces.name(): {string}|{nil}
    Returns the name of the current workspace or nil if no workspace is open.

workspaces.path(): {string}|{nil}
    Returns the path of the current workspace or nil if no workspace is open.

workspaces.sync_dirs()
   Synchronize all workspaces that are subfolders of registered directories.

workspaces.get_custom(name: {string}): {string}|{nil}
   Returns custom string data associated with a workspace.

workspaces.set_custom(name: {string}, data: {string})
   Sets custom string data associated with a workspace.

==============================================================================
TELESCOPE                                               *workspaces-telescope*

workspaces.nvim is bundled with a telescope picker extension. To enable, add
the following to your config >

    telescope.load_extension("workspaces")
<
The picker will list all workspaces. `<cr>` will open the selected workspace,
running any registered hooks. `<c-t>` will open the selected workspace in a new tab.

To keep nvim in insert mode (for example, when
chaining multiple telescope pickers), add the following to your telescope
setup function. >

    require("telescope").setup({
      extensions = {
        workspaces = {
          -- keep insert mode after selection in the picker, default is false
          keep_insert = true,
        }
      }
    })
<
After registration, the picker is available via |:Telescope workspaces|.

==============================================================================
EXAMPLES                                                 *workspaces-examples*

Remember that more than one hook is allowed, so these may be combined in
creative ways! Hooks may also be registered after adding and removing
workspaces, not only after opening a workspace.

Change directory to the workspace and run fzf. >
