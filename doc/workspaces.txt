INTRODUCTION                                                      *workspaces*

workspaces.nvim provides a few simple commands for managing workspace
directories in neovim. A workspace is a name and a path, and opening a
workspace will set the current directory to the correct path.

* Register a workspace with |:Workspaces add|
* Open a registered workspace with `:Workspaces open [name]`
* Hooks may be registered to provide additional functionality
* A telescope extension |:Telescope workspaces| is provided for fuzzy finding
  over workspaces

Nothing runs automatically. The idea is that workspace creation is an
infrequent task, so there shouldn't be any need for automatic workspace
registration, or heuristics to determine if a directory is a workspace. A
command and telescope extension are provided to make it simple to open a
workspace, but what that means beyond changing directories is left up to you by
customizing the hooks.

CONFIGURATION                                       *workspaces-configuration*

Call the setup function with a table as the argument to override the default
configuration. >

    require("workspaces.nvim").setup({
        -- path to a file to store workspaces data in
        -- on a unix system this would be ~/.local/share/nvim/workspaces
        path = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. util.path.sep .. "workspaces",

        -- to change directory for all of nvim (:cd) or only for the current
        window (:lcd). if you are unsure, you likely want this to be true.
        global_cd = true,

        -- sort the list of workspaces by name after loading from the
        -- workspaces path.
        sort = true,

        -- enable info-level notifications after adding or removing a
        -- workspace. disable to only be notified for warnings or errors.
        notify_info = true,

        -- lists of hooks to run after specific actions
        -- hooks can be a lua function or a vim command (string)
        -- if only one hook is needed, the list may be omitted
        hooks = {
            add = {},
            remove = {},
            open_pre = {}, -- run before changing directory
            open = {},     -- run after changing directory
        },
    })

USAGE                                                       *workspaces-usage*

:WorkspacesAdd [name] [path]                            *WorkspacesAdd*

If both name and path are omitted, the current working directory will be
registered as a workspace, with the last path segment as the name.

If only name is provided, one of two actions will follow. (1) if name looks
like a path, that path will be registered, (2) otherwise the current working
directory will be registered as a workspace, with the given name.

if both name and path are provided, the workspace with name and path will be
registered.

:WorkspacesRemove [name]                             *WorkspacesRemove*

If name is omitted, the workspace registered in the current working
directory will be removed, if it exists.

If name is provided, the specified workspace will be removed.

:WorkspacesList                                        *WorkspacesList*

Prints all workspaces.

:WorkspacesOpen [name]                                 *WorkspacesOpen*

Opens the named workspace. If no name is given, vim.ui.select() will be used
as a selection interface for opening a workspace.

All commands that take a workspace name (|:WorkspacesOpen| and
|:WorkspacesRemove|) offer workspace name completion. |:WorkspacesAdd| offers
filepath completion.

==============================================================================
HOOKS                                                       *workspaces-hooks*

There are 4 types of hooks that can be registered in three categories: add,
remove, and open.

Each hook may be either a single command or Lua function, or a list of
commands and Lua functions. See |workspaces-examples| for reference. If the
hook is a Lua function, it will be passed the workspace name and workspace
path as parameters.

If a Lua function hook returns false, any other registered hooks in the list
will be skipped. Furthermore, if the hook is an open_pre hook and returns
false, the directory will not be changed and any registered post-open hooks
will not be run.

add~
    run hooks after adding a workspace

remove~
    run hooks after removing a workspace

open~
    run hooks after changing directory when opening a workspace

open_pre~
    run hooks before changing directory when opening a workspace

API                                                           *workspaces-api*

local workspaces = require("workspaces")

workspaces.setup(opts: {table})
    Setup custom configuration and user commands. The details of opts are
    documented in |workspaces-configuration|

workspaces.add(path: {string}, name: {string})
    Add a workspace with the given name and path. If name or path are nil, the
    current directory will be used to set the missing parameter.

workspaces.remove(name: {string})
    Remove a workspace with the given name.

workspaces.list()
    Print all workspaces to the commandline.

workspaces.open(name: {string}|{nil})
    Open a workspace with the given name. If name is nil, vim.ui.select() will be
    used as a selection interface for opening a workspace.

workspaces.get(): {table}
    Returns a list of all workspaces in { name: {string}, path: {string} }
    pairs.

workspaces.name(): {string}|{nil}
    Returns the name of the current workspace or nil if no workspace is open.

==============================================================================
TELESCOPE                                               *workspaces-telescope*

workspaces.nvim is bundled with a telescope picker extension. To enable, add
the following to your config >

    telescope.load_extension("workspaces")
<
The picker will list all workspaces. `<cr>` will open the selected workspace,
running any registered hooks. To keep nvim in insert mode (for example, when
chaining multiple telescope pickers), add the following to your telescope
setup function. >

    require("telescope").setup({
      extensions = {
        workspaces = {
          -- keep insert mode after selection in the picker, default is false
          keep_insert = true,
        }
      }
    })
<
After registration, the picker is available via |:Telescope workspaces|.

==============================================================================
EXAMPLES                                                 *workspaces-examples*

Remember that more than one hook is allowed, so these may be combined in
creative ways! Hooks may also be registered after adding and removing
workspaces, not only after opening a workspace.

Change directory to the workspace and run fzf. >
